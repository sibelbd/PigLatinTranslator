# PigLatinTranslator
A pig latin translator made in Java using swing for a GUI.
The translator follows these rules:
-if the word begins with a vowel, the first letter is not moved to the back of the word
-if the first letter is not alphanumeric, it is not translated
-if there is punctuation at the end of a word, the punctuation is removed and added back to the word at the end to maintain proper grammar
